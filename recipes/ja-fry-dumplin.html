        Lovely Jamaican fried dumplings, the ultimate side dish
    </h5>

    <p>
        This is the dish you would like to prepare to top off a wonderful Jamaican Jerk Chicken meal. Jamaican fried dumplings are soft, succulent, and melt like butter in your mouth.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, cut into cubes and softened</li>
            <li>½ cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Rub in butter until the mixture is crumbly. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to form a firm dough; knead briefly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Break off pieces of dough and shape them into biscuit-like patties. Place just enough of the dumplings into the hot oil so they are not crowded; fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels before serving.
