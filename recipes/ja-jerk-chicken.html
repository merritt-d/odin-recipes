            Steps

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a blender or food processor, add all of the ingredients for the jerk marinade and blend until everything is well mixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss the chicken into a large ziplock freezer bag, then pour in the marinade. Close the bag and move the chicken around to make sure it's well coated with the marinade. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator overnight or for a minimum of 6 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the chicken is good to go, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the chicken in a lightly oiled 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Bake in the oven, uncovered, for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven, and let cool. Garnish with lime and green onion before serving.
